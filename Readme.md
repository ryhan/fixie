# Fixie.js


*This repository is a fork of https://github.com/ryhan/fixie, adding some features likes personal dictionary for filler contents, improved ignore rules, and updated documentation.*

Fixie is an open source tool that that automatically adds filler content to HTML documents. It's very simple, and we welcome contributions.

To learn more, check out the sample.html.

### Why use Fixie?

When designing and developing websites, it's often useful to add lorem ipsum text to see what your page will look like without worrying about your final content.

Unfortunately, adding lots of filler content involves lots of copy-pasting and manual editing, and also makes your HTML unwieldy.

**Fixie.js** makes filler content succinct, making it faster and easier to test out your designs.

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Add fixie.js

Add `<script type="text/javascript" src="fixie.js"></script>` to the bottom of your html document, right before your closing `</body>` tag.

### Step 2 - Add the `fixie` class.

Wherever you need filler content, set `class="fixie"`.

For example, if you wanted one filler paragraph, you could use
`<p class="fixie"></p>`

### Step 2 - Alternatively use `fixie.init`

Select where you want filler content using CSS selectors.

Call
```
fixie.init([".array", "#of > .selectors", ".that", ".should", "#be > .populated", ".with", ".lorem"])
```
or
```
fixie.init(".string, #of > .comma, .separated, .selectors, .that, .should, #be > .populated, .with, .lorem")
```
in the JavaScript console or within a `<script>` tag.

You can call Fixie on all empty elements on a page by calling:
```
fixie.init(':empty')
```

## Supported Elements

Fixie inserts the right type of content based on the tag name. Here are some major types you should be aware of:

- `<h1 class="fixie"></h1>` - Adds a few words of text. Same goes for `h2 - h6`
- `<p class="fixie"></p>` - Adds a paragraph of text.
- `<article class="fixie"></article>` - Adds several paragraphs of text.
- `<section class="fixie"></section>` - Adds several paragraphs of text.
- `<img class="fixie"></img>` - Adds an image which displays the width and height of the image.
- `<a class="fixie"></a>` - Adds a randomly named link.

*fixie ignore `<i|span class="[icn|icon]"></i|span>` matching any class begining or containing the `icn` or `icon` words.*
*ignore empty div*

## Tips

### Change the default dictionary

```javascript
var words= ["Je", "france", "sport", "aurait mieux fait", "super", "voir", "plus", "Mister-graphX"];
fixie.setWordLibrary(words).init();
```

### Change the default image placeholder service

<http://tinyfinch.com/top-12-image-placeholder-services/>


Use `fixie.setImagePlaceholder(source)`.


**Lorempixel**

Example http://www.lorempixel.com call

```javascript
fixie.setImagePlaceholder('http://www.lorempixel.com/${w}/${h}/${text}').init();
```

`<img class="fixie" width="300" height="200" title="sports"/>`

**Piscsum**

https://picsum.photos/

```javascript
fixie.setImagePlaceholder('https://picsum.photos/${w}/${h}/?${text}').init();
```
`<img class="fixie" width="300" height="200" title="[ramdom|image=0|blur|gravity=east]"/>`


### Add class fixie to containers

Fixie will act on all child elements, but will never
overwrite content within an element.

Consider the following example:

```xml
<div class="fixie">
<p>Hello <a></a></p>
</div>
```
Fixie will preserve the "Hello" text, but will
automatically add content to the link.

### Fixie for Rails

### Flagging filler content

When you start adding real copy to your page, try adding the following CSS to your stylesheet:

`.fixie{ border:4px solid red; }`

This CSS will highlight all of your dummy content, making it easier to make sure you didn't miss anything.
